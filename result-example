This is the last part of the result returned by the script: It shows duplicated SerialNumbers 2F, 30, 31 and 32
To avoid issues when some of this certs is revoked, you must revoked all them, and recreate new certs forevery user involved.

As example: The execution result shows that the "city1" and "audit03" certs are revoked in the "revocados" CRL.
But due to the duplicity of SerialNumbers, the openVPN tunnel that uses "revocados" as CRL also will consider revoked
the certs "hsanchez" and "uaIntro".
